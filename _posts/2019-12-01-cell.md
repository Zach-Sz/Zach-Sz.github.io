This was a class project in which our group chose to do cell tracking and segmentation from an open source dataset. We compared traditional segmentation techniques such as graph cut and level set methods to the U-Net deep learning segmentation model. In addition, we were able to identify separate individual cells and track their motion over consecutive frames using conventional computer vision techniques.
