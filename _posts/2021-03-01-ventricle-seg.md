This project was a part of my Master's research where the goal was to create an automatic deep learning segmentation approach which performed quickly and provided accurate segmentation results. We used the U-Net model as our baseline which is useful for small datasets like our own and well-suited for 3D ultrasound data. Some of our earlier preliminary work can be seen in our conference paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2581749) which looked into 2D multiplane models for solving our problem.

We are currently working on improving the results seen from our SPIE conference paper.
