<p>I am a MASc+AI student at the University of Guelph specializing in the the application of deep learning for biomedical image analysis. I have much experience
working in Python and MATLAB with an interest in computer vision and deep learning. I plan on graduating from my MASc+AI program this summer (2021) and am pursuing my PhD
in the fall at the University of Guelph.</p>
